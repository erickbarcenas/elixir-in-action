# Chapter 1
Chapter 1 provides a high-level overview of Erlang and Elixir and explains why those technologies are useful and what distinguishes them from other languages and platforms.


## Summary
-Erlang is a technology for developing highly available systems that constantly provide service with little or no downtime. It has been battle tested in diverse large systems for more than two decades


-Elixir is a modern language that makes development for the Erlang platform much more pleasant. It helps organize code more efficiently and abstracts away boilerplate, noise, and duplication.
